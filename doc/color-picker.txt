Picking Colors:

By default:
- `h` and `l` will increment the color slider value by 1.
- `u` and `i` / `a` and `d` / `A` and `D` will increment the slider value by 5.
- `s` and `w` / `S` and `W` will increment the color slider value by 10.

- Number `0` to `9` will set the slider at your cursor to certain percentages. 
  `0` sets to 0%, `9` sets to 90%, `5` sets to 50%.
- `H` sets to 0%, `M` sets to 50%, `L` sets to 100%.

Multiple Sliders:

By default:
- If your slider is on the `4th` line (the same line as the color output 
preview), when you increment / set a color value, it will apply that change 
to all 3 sliders above it.
- `gu` will select the 1st and 2nd sliders, `gd` will select 
the 2nd and 3rd sliders, `gm` will select the 1st and 3rd sliders.
- Press `x` will deselect the slider group.

Manual Numeric Input:

- If you press `n`, you can press number keys to input the color value
manually for individual sliders or slider group. If you press any key 
that is not a number key, it will execute that key as normal. 
- For example: if you want to input 15 on the 1st slider: move your
cursor to the 1st slider, press `n` then press `15`. Then you can
press `k` to move on to the next slider. The slider values will
update as you type out the numbers.

Converting Colors (RGB/HEX/HSL)
- When your cursor is on a corlor, use `:PickColor` to open up 
the picker, then press `o` to change the output type to `RGB/HEX/HSL`.
Press `Enter` and the color under your cursor will be converted.

Transparency Mode
- Press `t` to toggle Transparency Slider. While this mode is active,
you will only be able to output the color as `rgba()` or `hsla()`.
If you want to output as `HEX`, press `t` to get out of 
Transparency Mode, and you'll be able to press `o` to output
your color as `HEX`.
